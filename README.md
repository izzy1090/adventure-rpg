# text-adventure-combat-engine
This project is designed to emulate a text-based RPG combat engine made popular at the dawn of the gaming era in the early 80s.

Planned Features: 
1) Need to implement multiple states to switch between so that the game has a real combat flow
2) Scale experience to include multiple enemies and a walkable area where the player can engage with different enemies
3) Project may evolve into a visual project to include sprites
