# text-adventure-combat-engine
This project is designed to emulate a text-based RPG combat engine made popular at the dawn of the gaming era in the early 80s. The game currently utilizes a finite state machine to switch between modes of gameplay. If you're interested in seeing development as it progresses, you can view all the necessary components being developed seperately in the source folder.

The final goal is to port the entire experience out to SGDK and deploy a demo of the game utilizing an emulator with game sprites.

A more detailed Readme to describe the project is intended for the future. test
