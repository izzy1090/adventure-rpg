# text-adventure-combat-engine
This project is designed to emulate a text-based RPG combat engine made popular at the dawn of the gaming era in the early 80s.

Planned Features: 
1) Integrate a working Finite State Machine (FSM) to help control the flow of gameplay
3) Implement random encounters with enemies so I can start sandboxing gameplay mechanics to see what's fun
4) At some point, this would replace the above idea, but I would like to create a matrix to act as a behind the scenes map. This would allow enemies to remain fixed and hidden on the map so that if the player comes within a certain distance, triggers a battle. 
5) Project may evolve into a visual project to include sprites
