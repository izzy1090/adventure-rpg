# text-adventure-combat-engine
This project is designed to emulate a text-based RPG combat engine made popular at the dawn of the gaming era in the early 80s.

Planned Features: 
1) Implement a Finite State Machine (FSM) to control the enemy AI and create an engaging experience for the player
2) Scale experience to include multiple enemies and a walkable area where the player can engage with different enemies
3) Project may evolve into a visual project to include sprites
