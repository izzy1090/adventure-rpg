# text-adventure-combat-engine
This project is designed to emulate a text-based RPG combat engine made popular at the dawn of the gaming era in the early 80s.

Planned Features: 
1) Need to implement multiple states to switch between so that the game has a real combat flow
3) Need to implement random encounters so I can start sandboxing gameplay mechanics to see what's fun
3) Would like to create a matrix to act as a behind the scenes map. This would allow enemies to remain fixed and hidden on the map so that if the player comes within a certain distance, triggers a battle. 
4) Project may evolve into a visual project to include sprites
